## Features

## Wiki

MFC is an NFT-game that is driven by the problems in the current PFP-led NFT marketplace. 

MFC looks to meet the demand for utility NFTs with play-to-earn features. 

By utilising gamification & prize money, this project represents a long-term and sustainable project with ongoing benefits for holders. Not through complex, hard-to-grasp tokenomics - instead with simple, obvious & automated participation and rewards. 

For all of the information on the game, how the tournaments work & how to get involved see our [Wiki here](https://metaverse-fighting-championship.gitbook.io/mfc/).
